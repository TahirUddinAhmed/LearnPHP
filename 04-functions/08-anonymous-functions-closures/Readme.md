# Anonymous Function 
An anonymous function is a function that doesnâ€™t have a name. These are often used for short-lived purposes, like being assigned to a variable or passed as an argument to another function.

e.g
```php
$square = function ($a) {
    return $a * $a;
}

echo $square(5); // Output: 25
```

### Question 1
Can you explain how you might use an anonymous function as a callback in PHP? For example, how would you use it with the array_map() function? ðŸ˜Š

  ```php
    <?php
        $double = function($a) {
            return $a * 2;
        };
        $array = [1, 2, 3, 4];
        $result = array_map($double, $array);

        print_r($result);
    ?>
  ```

  #### Explanation
   1. Anonymous Function:
     - $double is an anonymous function that takes a single parameter $a and returns $a * 2.
     - This function is passed as a callback to array_map().
   2. `array_map()` Behavior:
     - array_map() applies the $double function to each element in the $array.
     - The result is a new array where each value is doubled.

### Question 2 
What if you didnâ€™t assign the anonymous function to a variable? How would you use it directly within array_map()? Try modifying your code to do this! ðŸ˜Š

  ```php
    <?php
        $array = [1, 2, 3, 4];
        $result = array_map(function($a) {
            return $a * 2;
        }, $array);

        print_r($result);
    ?>

  ```

  #### Explanation
   1. Inline Anonymous Function:
     - You passed the function directly to array_map() without assigning it to a variable. This keeps the code concise.
   2. Functionality:
     - Your anonymous function doubles each value in the array, and the result is correctly returned and printed.

# Closures
Closures in PHP are anonymous functions that can capture variables from their surrounding scope. This feature allows closures to maintain state and access variables even after their parent function has finished executing.

## Key features of Closures 
 - <b>Anonymous Functions</b>: Closures do not have a name and are defined inline. 
 - <b>Variable Capture</b>: They can access variable from the scope in which they are defined, using the `use` kyeowrd. 
 - <b>First-Class Function</b>: Closures can be assigned to variables, passed as arguments, or returned from other functions,. 

### Syntax Overview 
The basic syntax for defining a closure in PHP is as followsL: 
```php
$myClosure = function ($param1, $param2) use ($externalVariable) {
  // function body
}
```

### example 

```php
$counter = 1; 

// get the $counter as reference 
$multiply = function() use (&$counter) {
    $counter *= 2;
};

$multiply();
echo $counter; // output: 2
echo "<br>";
$multiply();
echo $counter; // output: 4
```
